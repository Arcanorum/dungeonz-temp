# Full setup

## You should understand to an intermediate level
- JavaScript/[NodeJS]((https://nodejs.org/en/download/) )
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Would also be useful to know, depending on what you are doing
- [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) (rendering, input, audio playback)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (GUI)
- [MongoDB]((https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)) (player accounts storage)

## To run the project, you will need:
- NodeJS installed (currently only v14.17.3 is officially supported, though other versions may work. If you are using a later version, you may run into this [issue arround node-sass build errors](https://github.com/Arcanorum/dungeonz/issues/164)).
- MongoDB installed (or in a Docker container).
- Git installed.
- An IDE.
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
- Maybe a Git GUI client (such as GitHub Desktop).

## Quickstart
Clone the project:

`git clone https://github.com/Arcanorum/dungeonz.git`

Enter the directory:

`cd dungeonz`

Install package dependencies:

`npm i`

Start the server with file watcher:

`npm run server:dev`

In another ternimal in the root of the project, start the client in dev mode:

`npm run client:dev`

>***Note:*** There are some resources that the server generates and adds to the client files when it starts that the client needs to work correctly, so when running in dev mode with the file watchers, every time the server restarts, the client may rebuild too. This is expected.

Finally, to open the client and play the game, go to http://localhost:3000 in a web browser.
